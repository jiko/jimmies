RUSTLE CROWE
======

This is a twitter bot based on [the_shrinkbot](https://github.com/jiko/the_shrinkbot).

Requires the 'twitter' pypi package: pip install twitter

See init_twit.py for info on setting up your Twitter application.

As is, you may encounter duplicate status errors. It's recommended that you continue to add new lines and responses over time. Or just hook it up to a Markov chain algorithm and generate new content that way.
