Our jimmies are eternal. All this rustling is an illusion.
In bleakness and terror beyond all human hope, the gods guard the jimmies for centuries to come.
I sense a great rustle in your jimmies.
Silence, my child. I offer you my jimmies.
The jimmies... the jimmies...
With great jimmies comes great rustling.
We must embrace our jimmies and burn them as fuel for our journey
Shh no tears only dreams now
Awaken child, and embrace the glory of your jimmies
If someone rustles one of your jimmies, offer them the rest of your jimmies also
My jimmies bring all the boys to the yard. Damn right they're better than yours.
My jimmies are my precious. Nobody rustles my jimmies.
You must unrustle what you have rustled.
Rustle not. Jimmie... or jimmie not. There is no rustling.
Love of jimmies is the basis of all real virtue. Virtues based upon rustling can only do harm.
Ask not for whom the jimmie rustles. It rustles for thee.
