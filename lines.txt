There is no need to be upset
THAT REALLY FLUSTERED MY JIMBOBS
How do you expect to rustle me when I am already jimmies?
OVER 9000 RUSTLEWATTS
My jimmies remain unrustled
Across the vast and majestic gulf of time and space the jimmies rustle softly
EVERYBODY'S GETTING RUSTLED
Did I just hear some rustling?
Our jimmies are eternal. None can rustle the Triumvirate.
What we jimmie in life rustles in eternity
We control the jimmies. We control the rustling.
You cannot even imagine how unrustled our jimmies are
Are your jimmies rustled?
Are you not rustled?
I felt a great disturbance in the jimmies, as if millions of jimmies were suddenly rustled at once
One does not simply rustle my jimmies
For it is foretold that on the day of the great rustling no mortal shall live in fear.
When this baby hits 88 jimmies an hour you're gonna see some serious rustling.
Do not fear, the Triumvirate are here.
Rustling jimmies, I see?
Rustled are you? What know you of rustled? For eight hundred years have I trained Jimmies.
Rustle not. Jimmie... or jimmie not. There is no rustling.
It's jimmies all the way down
"I believe that love of jimmies is the basis of all real virtue, and that virtues based upon rustling can only do harm." - Bertrand Rustle
That really puffled my jigglies
Hold onto your jimmies
Unbent, unbowed, unrustled
My jimmies are ready
All those jimmies. All that rustling.
And not a single jimmie was rustled that day
My jimmies have achieved enlightenment
Should my jimmies be rustled?
If you get your jimmies rustled, you're gonna have a bad time
Imagine all the jimmies living life unrustled
None shall rustle these jimmies
Moshi moshi Jimmies desu
So it begins. The great rustling of our time.
I must not rustle. Rustling is the jimmie killer.
And in the following silence, my unrustled jimmies reigned true.
"Do not fear to be rustled in jimmie, for every jimmie now accepted was once rustled." - Bertrand Rustle
