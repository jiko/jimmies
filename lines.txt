There is no need to be upset
My jimmies remain unrustled
Across the vast and majestic gulf of time and space the jimmies rustle softly
EVERYBODY'S GETTING RUSTLED
Did I just hear some rustling?
Our jimmies are eternal. None can rustle the Triumvirate.
What we jimmie in life rustles in eternity
We control the jimmies. We control the rustling.
You cannot even imagine how unrustled our jimmies are
Are your jimmies rustled?
Seems like your jimmies are rustled.
Are you not rustled?
I felt a great disturbance in the jimmies, as if millions of jimmies were suddenly rustled at once
One does not simply rustle my jimmies
For it is foretold that on the day of the great rustling no mortal shall live in fear.
We must embrace our jimmies and burn them as fuel for our journey
Shh no tears only dreams now
Awaken child, and embrace the glory of your jimmies

If someone rustles your right jimmie, turn to him your other one
Do not fear, the Triumvirate are here.
When this baby hits 88 jimmies an hour you're gonna see some serious rustling.
Our jimmies are eternal. All this rustling is an illusion.
THAT REALLY FLUSTERED MY JIMBOBS
How do you expect to rustle me when I am already jimmies?
OVER 9000 RUSTLEWATTS
In bleakness and terror beyond all human hope, the gods guard the jimmies for centuries to come
I sense a great rustle in your jimmies
Silence, my child. I offer you my jimmies
The jimmies... the jimmies...
With great jimmies comes great rustling
