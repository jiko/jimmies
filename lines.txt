There is no need to be upset
My jimmies remain unrustled
Across the vast and majestic gulf of time and space the jimmies rustle softly
EVERYBODY'S GETTING RUSTLED
Did I just hear some rustling?
Our jimmies are eternal. None can rustle the Triumvirate.
What we jimmie in life rustles in eternity
We control the jimmies. We control the rustling.
You cannot even imagine how unrustled our jimmies are
Are your jimmies rustled?
Seems like your jimmies are rustled.
Are you not rustled?
I felt a great disturbance in the jimmies, as if millions of jimmies were suddenly rustled at once
One does not simply rustle my jimmies
For it is foretold that on the day of the great rustling no mortal shall live in fear.
We must embrace our jimmies and burn them as fuel for our journey
Shh no tears only dreams now
Awaken child, and embrace the glory of your jimmies
